      <p>I am an introverted person. I'm not very good at communicating with people, but I am
        good at putting my ideas into action. Since I came to Kansas State University, I have 
        learned a lot and made a lot of friends. I feel lucky because I have a very happy time here.</p>
      <p>In university, I enjoy learning the knowledge about computer technology because I
        can master a lot of useful skill. Now, I am a senior student and plan to graduate in
        May 2019 from Kansas State University with a Bachelor of Computer Science. I am
        going to go back to my country after graduating. I expect that I can find a job about
         computer technology in my country</p>
